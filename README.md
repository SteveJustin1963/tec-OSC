# tec-OSC


## TE 14-21; 
"This project is a crystal oscillator for the
TEC. It turns the TEC into a fixed frequency computer in which each of the
Machine Codes takes up a precise period
of time.
This means programs such as controller
programs or timing programs will run for
a precise time span and will not vary from
one day to the next due to speed control
adjustments."

BG has shrunk this pcb down to the size of the 4049 ic and goes into the socket. its available in different clock speeds, preferably standard baud rates.
A propsed idea of selectable values and a VCO option exists as well.
I would also like to add a single stepper version with bus LEDS for debugging.
