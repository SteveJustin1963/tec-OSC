TE 14-21

"This project is a crystal oscillator for the
TEC. It turns the TEC into a fixedfrequency computer in which each of the
Machine Codes takes up a precise period
of time.
This means programs such as controller
programs or timing programs will run for
a precise time span and will not vary from
one day to the next due to speed control
adjustments."
